## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep orange (#E67700) for a construction-oriented feel without directly copying the example's orange/blue combo.
- Background color: Very light orange (#FAF2EB). Background must contrast effectively with dark text while remaining harmonious with the app's construction theme.
- Accent color: Muted green (#94B3A4), a complementary contrast color drawn from construction safety and vegetation. The design evokes the meeting of nature and building.  This creates visual interest.
- Headers: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of body text.
- Body: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer paragraphs of body text.
- Use flat, line-based icons for a modern and clean look, with the electric blue accent color to highlight AI-driven features.
- Implement a grid-based layout for a structured and organized appearance, ensuring consistency across all screens.
